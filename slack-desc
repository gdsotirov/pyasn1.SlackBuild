pyasn1: PyASN.1 (ASN.1 types and codecs for Python)
pyasn1:
pyasn1: This is an implementation of ASN.1 types and codecs in Python
pyasn1: programming language. It has been first written to support particular
pyasn1: protocol (SNMP), but then generalized to be suitable for a wide range
pyasn1: of protocols based on ASN.1 specification.
pyasn1: It features generic implementation of ASN.1 types (X.208), fully
pyasn1: standard compliant BER/CER/DER codecs, 100% Python (works with 2.4 to
pyasn1: 3.5), multi-thread safe, but it has no ASN.1 compiler and codecs are
pyasn1: not restartable
